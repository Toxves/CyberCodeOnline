Every runner in this city cut their teeth on the worst gun in the game. 

The one with all the old soft, the one that jammed every other shot, the one with the janky back alley AI that could only speak in limericks... Point is, sometimes to get the job done you gotta use what you have.

Now grab that piece out of the dumpster and get gunning, Choom.
